# Computer Vision Learning

## Description

This repository is my storage for computer vision materials, references and
my own learning process. At some point I realized that it is better for me to 
save my learning process somewhere. The second reason, I want to have my own 
notes and references on different methods in computer vision field. For 
example, if I need to remember some methods or theory, I can simply run through 
these notes and check references to brush up on topics. Also I have some bias 
to classic computer vision methods and topics, like tracking, optical flow and 
so on. So the resources here are appropriate

## Courses

__Courses by RWTH Aachen University__

At this university there are several scientists who are actively involved in 
object tracking tasks and I found some courses in machine learning and computer 
vision.

## Other Topics

Here are topics on which I either have not yet found materials, or have not yet 
planned. Also topics that I would like to repeat or deepen—é

- Projective geometry
- Linear Algebra
- Analytic geometry
- Kalman Filters
- SOTA MOT Trackers and tracking tasks other than MOT
- 3D Computer Vision
- Transformers (NN architecture)
